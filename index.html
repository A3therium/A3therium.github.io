			Why do people like gifs so much?
			</H2>
			<P>
			They are portable. GIFs work just about anywhere and everywhere.
			We watch them passively. Meaning they autoplay. No need to engage.
			They are quiet. Like still images, GIFs don’t interrupt you.
			They are an easy form of communication. It’s surprising how much you can say with a well-timed GIF.
			They are funny! GIFs can be inside jokes amongst friends. When someone uses the right gif at the right time it’s comedy.
			They are educational. There is a GIF for everything! Search GIPHY for any random thing and chances are you will find a moving visual representation of it. It’s a great visual way to pass on information.
